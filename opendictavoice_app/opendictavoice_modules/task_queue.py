"""
    Module containing the definition of FIFO class,
    which is supposed to manage the order in which recognized texts are returned.

    Indeed, for ergonomic reasons, the program is made so that the user can start recording again while
    the previous sound is not finished translating.

    If the second sound was translated and returned while the first was still being processed,
    then a sentence said after another would be written before the latter.

    That's why the FIFO class exists, to store translating processes and return it in correct order.

    Explanations:
    ============

    The FIFO object has 1 attribute:
    - self._fifo: a list containing the translating processes. Each new translating process is appended
                  to this list

    A translating Process is a dict with 3 keys:
    - id: the id of the translating process, which is technically len(self._fifo)
          at the moment it is appened to the fifo

    - state: string that can be "PROCESSING" if translate is not done yet, or "DONE" if it is
    - value: string of the translation, that is empty('') if translate is not done yet

    For examples:
    {id: 42, state: 'PROCESSING', value: ''}
    or
    {id: 42, state: 'DONE', value: 'Hello everybody'}

    Each time a translation is done, we can check if self._fifo[0] has the state "DONE",
    if yes, we return its value, remove the process from the list and we check again self._fifo[0]
    which is the following process, etc etc
